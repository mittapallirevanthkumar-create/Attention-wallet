# 🎮 Attention Wallet - Hackathon Project

## 📖 About
Attention Wallet is a gamified digital wellbeing app for children that teaches them to value their attention like money. Kids earn tokens by doing healthy offline activities and spend tokens when using apps.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Kids spend hours on mobile apps without realizing their attention is being captured, trained, and sold. We teach children how to save money, but no one teaches them how to save their attention.

## 💡 Solution
**"Your Attention Is Your Money"**

Make kids think: *"If I waste my attention, I lose my tokens."*
